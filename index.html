                <p>
                    Knitting calculations are essential for creating well-fitting and properly proportioned knitwear, whether
                    you're
                    following a pattern or designing your own. Here are some of the most common knitting calculations and how
                    they are used:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Gauge:</strong> Gauge is the number of stitches and rows per inch or centimeter that you achieve
                    when knitting with a particular
                    yarn and needle size. To calculate gauge, you typically cast on a certain number of stitches, work for a set
                    number of
                    rows, and then measure the resulting fabric. Accurate gauge is crucial for ensuring that your finished
                    project matches
                    the intended size in a pattern.
                <p></p>
                <strong>Stitch Count:</strong> You might need to calculate the number of stitches to cast on for a project,
                which depends on your gauge
                and the desired measurements. To do this, multiply your desired width by your gauge in stitches per inch (or
                centimeter).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Row Count:</strong> Similarly, you might need to calculate the number of rows to knit for a specific
                    section of your project.
                    This involves multiplying the desired length by your gauge in rows per inch (or centimeter).
                    Increases and Decreases: When shaping a project, such as creating a waistline in a sweater, you need to
                    calculate how to
                    evenly distribute increases or decreases. For instance, if you're increasing stitches evenly across a row,
                    divide the
                    total number of stitches to be increased by the number of increases needed, and then space them accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Yarn Length:</strong> To determine how much yarn you need for a project, you'll need to calculate
                    the yardage required based on
                    the yarn weight and the number of stitches and rows. Patterns usually provide information on how many yards
                    are required
                    for a specific size, but you can also calculate it based on your gauge and measurements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Yarn Substitution:</strong> If you want to use a different yarn than what's specified in a pattern,
                    you'll need to calculate how
                    it will affect your gauge and make necessary adjustments to ensure the finished project's size matches the
                    pattern.
                </p>
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="modal-gauge" class=" modal black-bkgr">
            <div>
            <h2>Calculate your gauge</h2> <button class="btn" id="close-modal">x</button>
            </div>
            <p>Knitting a swatch to calculate your gauge is an important step when working on a knitting project, especially if you
            want your finished piece to have the correct size and fit. Use the same yarn and size of knitting needles you plan to
            use for your project. Begin by casting on a certain number of stitches. Typically, this is around 20-30 stitches.
            </p>
            <p>
            After knitting several rows, you'll want to measure your swatch. Lay it flat and use a measuring tape or ruler to
            measure the number of stitches across (horizontally) and the number of rows (vertically) within a 4-inch (10 cm) square.
            To calculate your gauge, you'll need to count how many stitches you have per 4 inches horizontally and how many rows per
            4 inches vertically. For example, if you have 20 stitches and 28 rows in 4 inches, your gauge would be 20 stitches and
            28 rows per 4 inches.
            </p>
            <p>
            If your gauge does not match the gauge specified in the pattern, you may need to adjust your needle size. If your swatch
            has more stitches per 4 inches than the pattern specifies, try larger needles. If it has fewer stitches, try smaller
            needles. Knit another swatch with the adjusted needles and measure again until you achieve the correct gauge.

        <section id="modal-cast-on" class=" modal black-bkgr">
            <div>
                <h2>Calculate how many stitches to cast-on</h2><button class="btn" id="close-modal">x</button>
                </div>
                <p>To calculate how many stitches to cast on for a knitting project, you'll need to consider your gauge and the desired
                width of your project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the number of stitches to cast on:
                Round to the Nearest Whole Number: If your calculation doesn't result in a whole number, round to the nearest whole
                number. In knitting, you can't cast on a fraction of a stitch, so round up or down to the nearest whole stitch as
                needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                Remember that achieving the correct gauge is crucial for your project to turn out as expected. If your gauge swatch
                doesn't match the gauge specified in your pattern, you may need to adjust your needle size and knit another swatch until
                you achieve the correct gauge. Always knit a gauge swatch before starting a new project to ensure your finished item
                will be the right size.
