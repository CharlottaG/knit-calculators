            Knitting a swatch to calculate your gauge is an important step when
            working on a knitting project, especially if you want your finished
            piece to have the correct size and fit. Use the same yarn and size
            of knitting needles you plan to use for your project. Begin by
            casting on a certain number of stitches. Typically, this is around
            20-30 stitches.
          </p>
          <p>
            After knitting several rows, you'll want to measure your swatch. Lay
            it flat and use a measuring tape or ruler to measure the number of
            stitches across (horizontally) and the number of rows (vertically)
            within a 4-inch (10 cm) square. To calculate your gauge, you'll need
            to count how many stitches you have per 4 inches horizontally and
            how many rows per 4 inches vertically. For example, if you have 20
            stitches and 28 rows in 4 inches, your gauge would be 20 stitches
            and 28 rows per 4 inches.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your gauge does not match the gauge specified in the pattern, you
            may need to adjust your needle size. If your swatch has more
            stitches per 4 inches than the pattern specifies, try larger
            needles. If it has fewer stitches, try smaller needles. Knit another
            swatch with the adjusted needles and measure again until you achieve
            the correct gauge.

        <div>
          <p>
            To calculate how many stitches to cast on for a knitting project,
            you'll need to consider your gauge and the desired width of your
            project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the
            number of stitches to cast on: Round to the Nearest Whole Number: If
            your calculation doesn't result in a whole number, round to the
            nearest whole number. In knitting, you can't cast on a fraction of a
            stitch, so round up or down to the nearest whole stitch as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that achieving the correct gauge is crucial for your
            project to turn out as expected. If your gauge swatch doesn't match
            the gauge specified in your pattern, you may need to adjust your
            needle size and knit another swatch until you achieve the correct
            gauge. Always knit a gauge swatch before starting a new project to
            ensure your finished item will be the right size.

          <h3>Calculate the amount of yarn needed</h3>
          <span class="close-modal" onclick="closeModalYarn()">x</span>
          <p>
            To calculate how much yarn you'll need for a knitting project,
            you'll need to consider several factors, including the type of yarn,
            your gauge, the size of the project, and any specific pattern
            instructions.

            >x</span
          >
          <p>
            Keep in mind that the type of increase or decrease you use (e.g.,
            knit/purl increases, knit2tog, SSK for decreases) and the specific
            pattern you're following can affect how you calculate and execute
            them. Always refer to your pattern's instructions for any specific
            increase or decrease methods and placement guidelines.
