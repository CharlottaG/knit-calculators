## Purpose and target audience
The purpose of the site is to facilitate all calculations related to knitting and gather them in one place.
The target audience is obviously knitters, no matter the experience level, you need to do calculations.

### User stories
**As a beginner knitter**, I want a knit calculator to help me count stitches and rows, so I can keep track of my progress and create accurate, well-proportioned projects.
    
**As an experienced knitter**, I need a yarn estimation feature in the knit calculator to determine the exact amount of yarn required for my project, considering different variables such as gauge and stitch pattern.
    
**As a pattern enthusiast**, I would like the knit calculator to provide a gauge conversion tool to adapt patterns with different gauge measurements, making it easier to follow patterns that don't match my yarn or needle size.

 **As a beginning or intermediate knitter**, I want the knit calculator to guide me on how many stitches to cast on and how to increase or decrease evenly.
 
#### User stories for future development
  **As a creative knitter**, I want the calculator to assist me in scaling patterns up or down, ensuring that I can adjust projects to my desired size and achieve a perfect fit.
    
  **As a budget-conscious crafter**, I require the yarn substitution feature in the knit calculator to help me select alternative yarns while ensuring that the new yarn's characteristics match the original pattern's requirements.
    
  **As a frequent pattern user**, I need a yarn weight conversion tool to easily switch between different yarn weight classifications, making it simpler to use patterns from various sources.


  ## Design and usability
The website has been thoughtfully designed with a mobile-first approach, recognizing that users will likely use it as a handy tool during their knitting activities. The primary emphasis is on calculations, featuring prominently sized buttons that allow users to easily navigate to their desired information or calculations. Results have been purposefully designed to stand out, ensuring effortless visibility, especially on smaller mobile screens.

The color palette has been carefully chosen to offer excellent contrast, enabling users to focus on the most essential elements. Additionally, a black opacity background has been applied to frame different calculations, providing added clarity to distinguish information related to each specific calculation.

To facilitate user decision-making, all calculations are displayed right from the start, allowing users to quickly determine if the site offers the calculations they require. To streamline the user experience and reduce the number of inputs, the calculations intelligently retrieve answers from previous calculations, eliminating the need for users to repetitively enter information they've already provided.

### Color palette

**Buttons and modal windows**  employ a contrasting combination of orange backgrounds with black text, ensuring clear visibility and distinction.

### Typography
The Patrick Hand font was chosen for the logo to evoke a creative and crafty aesthetic.
For the body copy, a sans-serif font, Raleway, has been selected to maintain a tranquil and serene atmosphere.

## Functionality

The site incorporates (at this point) four calculations to assist knitters in various aspects of their projects:

1.  **Stitches and Rows per Centimeter**: This calculation determines, based on the user's swatch, how many stitches and rows their knitting gauge is per centimeter, providing a tool for recalculating to match projects with a different gauge.
    
2.  **Stitches to Cast-On and Rows to Knit**: This feature guides the yser in deciding how many stitches to cast on and the number of rows to knit to achieve a project's dimensions accurately.
    
3.  **Skeins Needed**: For efficient yarn management, this calculation helps you estimate the number of skeins or balls of yarn required to complete a specific knitting project.
    
4.  **Evenly Increasing or Decreasing**: This tool is valuable for evenly distributing increases or decreases in your knitting, ensuring a polished final result with balanced shaping.
